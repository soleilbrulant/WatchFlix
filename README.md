How I Learned and Applied Skills
Throughout the development of WatchFLix, I utilized a variety of skills and resources. I used HTML and CSS to create the structure and style of the website, learning about modern design patterns and the importance of responsive design for mobile users. By integrating JavaScript, I added dynamic functionality, such as searching and displaying real-time data.

I also explored AJAX and API integration to fetch movie data, allowing me to display real-time information without the need for reloading the page. This improved user experience and helped me understand the importance of client-server communication in web development.

To enhance the user interface, I implemented a sleek animated background using CSS animations and transitions. Additionally, I added modal pop-ups to display movie details in a clean and interactive way.

What I Learned and Implemented
API Integration: How to connect to an external API (IMDB API) and fetch data asynchronously.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the site is functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
JavaScript: How to manipulate the DOM, handle user input, and dynamically update content.
CSS Animations: Creating smooth background transitions and interactive elements.
Modal Windows: Displaying additional content in an overlay for a clean user experience.
User Experience (UX): Focusing on intuitive design and ensuring smooth interaction.
I also leveraged AI modal features for improved interactive behavior, ensuring that the pop-up windows for movie details provided the user with a seamless and engaging experience.
